"""
Linear programming optimization algorithms.

This module contains algorithms for solving optimization problems with linear objective
functions subject to linear constraints. These methods are fundamental to optimization
theory and serve as building blocks for more complex optimization problems.

Linear programming deals with continuous variables and focuses on problems where both
the objective function and constraints are linear. These algorithms find extensive use
in resource allocation, production planning, network flow, and economic modeling.
