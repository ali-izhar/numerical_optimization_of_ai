"""
Combinatorial optimization algorithms.

This module contains algorithms for solving optimization problems with discrete solution spaces,
where the goal is to find the best solution among a finite or countably infinite set of possibilities.
These algorithms are distinct from pure combinatorics, focusing instead on optimization techniques
for problems with combinatorial structure.
