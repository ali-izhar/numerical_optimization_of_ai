Stochastic optimization algorithms.

This module contains algorithms for solving optimization problems under uncertainty,
where some problem parameters are random variables with known distributions. These
methods are essential for decision-making in uncertain environments.

Stochastic optimization differs from deterministic optimization by explicitly
incorporating probabilistic elements into the model. These algorithms are widely
used in portfolio optimization, supply chain management, and machine learning
where decisions must be made with incomplete information.
