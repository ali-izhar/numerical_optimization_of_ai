"""
Integer programming optimization algorithms.

This module contains algorithms for solving optimization problems where some or all
variables are restricted to integer values. These methods are crucial for discrete
optimization problems like facility location, scheduling, and resource allocation.

Integer programming is distinct from continuous optimization, focusing on problems
where fractional solutions are not meaningful or allowed. Many of these algorithms
build upon linear programming techniques with additional methods to handle the
integer constraints.
